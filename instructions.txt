Donkey Kong Country - Java Edition
Written by Jack Harkins

The objective of this game is to defeat all of the enemies in a level without
getting hurt. Getting hit by an enemy causes your character (DK) to lose a life.
You can gain extra lives by collecting 100 bananas, all four KONG letters, or
brightly-colored balloons. If all of your lives run out, the game is over.
